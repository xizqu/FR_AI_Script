Project Read Me

AI_Script_BASE is solely for base moves and abilities ONLY. The AI_EXPANSION is for adding abilities and moves. Please follow the same formats for consitstency. Consitstency will make is easy for the community to add moves without much hassle. I have included a few moves in the expansion file for examples. 

In the modified scripts, if its "jumpifmovescriptequals HEX ID" this move is already in the base game. If its "jumpifmovescriptequals
MOVESCR_NAME" this is an added move. If you the movescr has @Return, it has not be fully added. If you see "MOVESCR_NAME @AI_NAME" then it has been added. For example, you will see "jumpifmovescriptequals MOVESCR_MirrorMove @AI_MirrorMove". This move has been added by me or another participant. Please review these to make sure no mistakes were added!

After you add a move, please put //your user name so i or another person knows who added it. This will make it easy for myself or someone else to contact you if we are confused on why you did it this way or if there was an error. Also, its nice to have credits lol

The scripts in "Ai_Scripts" are ready for compiling. They are not game ready but currently have no major errors.

We need to agree on how we rate moves for the viabilty score. Status moves > Damaging? That type of thing.

The modified plus script isnt fully labeled.

Credits go to skeli for the python compiler.

Credits to akamethebulbasaur and skeli for rewritten and new ai commands.
