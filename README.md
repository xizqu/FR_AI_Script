Project Read Me

1. AI_Script_BASE is solely for base moves and abilities. The AI_EXPANSION is for adding abilities and moves. Please follow the same formats for consitstency. Consitstency will make is easy for the community to add moves without much hassle. I have included a few moves in the expansion file for examples. 

2. The scripts in "Ai_Scripts" are ready for compiling. They are not game ready but they currently have no major errors.

3. We need to agree on how we rate moves for the viabilty score. Status moves > Damaging? That type of thing.
