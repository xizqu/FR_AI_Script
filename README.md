# FR_AI_Script

1. AI_Script_BASE is solely for base moves and abilities. The AI_EXPANSION is for adding abilities and moves. Please follow the same formats for consitstency. Consitstency will make is easy for the community to add moves without much hassle. I have included a few moves in the expansion file for examples.
